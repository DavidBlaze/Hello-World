# Hello-World
Attempting to learn some more code.
I have learned enough java code to know that I have a lot to learn.  I am also beginning to learn Javascript and HTML5.  I used to program in Pascal way back in 1991, and eventually want to learn C++.  Right now I'm just trying to learn something new every day.  I'm a slow learner, so this might take awhile...
